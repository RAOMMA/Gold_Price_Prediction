# Gold Price Prediction

This Python script predicts the price of gold based on various financial indicators. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Gold Price Dataset
- **Data Source**: Dataset upload on git

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **gold_price_prediction.py**: Python script for predicting gold prices.
- **model.joblib**: Pre-trained machine learning model for gold price prediction.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gold_price_prediction

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the pre-trained machine learning model ('model.joblib') in the same directory as the script ('gold_price_prediction.py').
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script with the `--SPX`, `--USO`, `--SLV`, and `--USD` arguments followed by the corresponding financial indicators.

## For example:
      ```
      python gold_price_prediction.py --SPX 1234.56 --USO 45.67 --SLV 78.90 --USD 1.234


Follow the instructions in the script to make predictions.

## Model Training

The project uses a machine learning model to predict gold prices. The pre-trained model is saved as 'model.joblib'.

## Evaluation

The script provides predictions for gold prices based on the input financial indicators.

## Results

The project offers predictions for gold prices, and the accuracy may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements

There are several ways to enhance the model and the project:

- Explore advanced machine learning techniques.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
